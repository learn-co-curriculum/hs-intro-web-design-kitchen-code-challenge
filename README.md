# Your Mama Said...
## Put The Groceries Away

Your mom has tasked you with putting away the groceries for your chose this week. It's bleak in that fridge. The only thing that's in there is a single green apple. Fortunately for you, it's not as physical a task as it once was. Now, all you need to do is write the correct code to put the groceries where they belong.

You will be coding your solution in `css/kitchen.css`. You'll want to have `index.html` open in the text editor as well as the browser.

First, you gotta put the OJ away. Look for the comment `/*insert selector for orange juice*/` in `css/kitchen.css`. You'll want to use the ID defined on the OJ image in `index.html` as your CSS selector.

## Apple
