# Your Mama Said...
## Put The Groceries Away

Your mom has tasked you with putting away the groceries for your chose this week. It's bleak in that fridge. The only thing that's in there is a single green apple. Fortunately for you, it's not as physical a task as it once was. Now, all you need to do is write the correct code to put the groceries where they belong.

You will be coding your solution in `css/kitchen.css`. You'll want to have `index.html` open in the text editor as well as the browser.


## Orange Juice

First, you gotta put the OJ away. Look for the comment `/*insert selector for orange juice*/` in `css/kitchen.css`. You'll want to use the ID defined on the OJ image in `index.html` as your CSS selector.

## Apple

Let's put the cheese away. That cheese looks stinky if we leave it sitting out. Look for the comment `/*insert selector for cheese*/` in `css/kitchen.css`. You'll want to use the class defined on the cheese image in `index.html` as your CSS selector.

## Bread

Bread shouldn't go in the fridge. Too much moisture makes it moldy. We just want to leave the bread on the counter. Look for the comment `/*insert selector for bread*/` in `css/kitchen.css`. You'll want to use the id defined on the bread image in `index.html` as your CSS selector.

## Chicken

CHICKEN WINGS! THANKS MOM! Let's put that platter in the fridge. You'll want to look for the comment `/*insert selector for chicken*/` in `css/kitchen.css`. You'll want to use the class defined on the chicken wings image in `index.html` as your CSS selector.

## Cake
